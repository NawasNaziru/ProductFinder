/*Yes, you can append two JSON files of the same structure and format in Node.js or JavaScript. Here is a simple example of how you can do it:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Read the first JSON file
let data1 = fs.readFileSync('file1.json');
let json1 = JSON.parse(data1);

// Read the second JSON file
let data2 = fs.readFileSync('file2.json');
let json2 = JSON.parse(data2);

// Append json2 data to json1
json1 = json1.concat(json2);

// Write the appended data to a new JSON file
fs.writeFileSync('appended.json', JSON.stringify(json1, null, 2));
```

In this example, `file1.json` and `file2.json` are the two JSON files you want to append. The `readFileSync` function reads the files, and `JSON.parse` converts the file data to JavaScript objects. The `concat` function appends `json2` to `json1`. Finally, `JSON.stringify` converts the JavaScript object back to a JSON string, and `writeFileSync` writes this string to a new file named `appended.json`.

Please replace `'file1.json'`, `'file2.json'`, and `'appended.json'` with your actual file paths. Also, ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine and that you have the necessary permissions to read and write files.

Remember that this code assumes that your JSON files contain arrays of objects. If your JSON structure is different, you may need to adjust the code accordingly. For example, if your JSON files contain objects (not arrays), you could merge them using the spread operator (`...`) in JavaScript:

```javascript
let mergedJson = {...json1, ...json2};
```

This will create a new object that contains properties from both `json1` and `json2`. If both objects have a property with the same name, the property from `json2` will overwrite the one from `json1`.
